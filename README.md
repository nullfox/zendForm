zendForm
======

This plugin is designed to allow you to automatically display animated validation errors and provide simple success/error callback support by leveraging the jquery.form.js. This plugin will attempt to automatically determine whether there is a file uploaded and can have a default error selection or function defined for validation message formatting, as well as per form element selectors or methods to handle tricky formatting and/or form elements.
